Hello World! I'm David Mitjana, a web developer from Barcelona, and I give you a warm welcome to my personal website / blog / portfolio / whatever it turns out to be in the future. 

Like may new things a programmer does, I thought a suitable title for the very first entrance of the blog would be "Hello World". It also makes sense since it's my first "appearence" in the internet.

The goal of this blog is to return to the community of developers everything it gives in our daily lifes, helping in our work and personal projects. It also satisfies my need of trying to explain something I've learned or something I already know, in order to have a better understanding.

Besides this because, **it feels good to have my own little corner of internet for the first time**.

The topics you'll find in this blog will range from general or common issues to more specific and complex ones. I'll be talking mainly about web development, though some random topics may appear on the way! 

Last but no least, I want to make clear that I'm not an expert on any of the topics I'll be talking about, so any constructive criticism is more than welcome! It will help to improve the quality of the content and hence the answer it can be given to anyone looking for that specific problem.

With that said, happy coding and enjoy the reading!


Salut! 

David
