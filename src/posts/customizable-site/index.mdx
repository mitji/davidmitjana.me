The same way you can customize your reading experience in Safari with some newspapers websites, why can't this be possible in any other website?
Nowadays people talk a lot about accessibility, and I strongly believe this have to include the flexibility of your site to adapt to the user's preferences.

It is ok if you do a lot of research on which is the best typography for texts, serif/sans-serif, 16/18/20 px for the text... and the list goes and goes. 
That's why I've decided to allow the users reading or experiencing this website to customize their experience to their preferences, which are saved for whenever they want to 
come back and read more (unless you intentionally remove your preferences from the localstorage of horse...).

Right now there are just a few preferences:
- light/dark theme
- titles serif/sans-serif
- text serif/sans-serif
- text size

The idea is to add more site settings, such as different fonts to choose, different themes... Any suggestions, contact me at contact@davidmitjana.me
