Rugby Survival is an evasion game inspired in rugby and the Rugby World Cup 2019 (ongoing while doing this project). You play against a number of defenders (3 to 5 depending on level) that will try to tackle you. If you score a try, this gives you 5 points, and if you're tackled, the opposition scores 5 points. The game finishes when one of the two teams score 25 points or more.
