Hello World! I'm David Mitjana, a web developer from Barcelona, and I give you a warm welcome to my personal blog / portfolio / whatever it turns out to be in the future. 

Like any new piece of code which has been written, and as any newbie step in a developer career, I thought the first entrance of the blog should be titled "Hello World". It also makes sense since it's my first appearence in the internet,

The goal of this blog is to return to the community of developers everything it has given to me, and everything it gives and will continue giving. It also satisfies my need of trying to explain something I've learned or something I already know, in order to have a better understanding, since I believe trying to explain a concept is the best way to fully understand it. *Learning by coding*. It'll also help to improve my writing skills in english, and also because writing in catalan or spanish is what I do in my day to day, and is always nice to -sortir de la nostra zona de comfort-.

Also because, as Dan Abramov stated in <OuterLink href="https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/why-my-new-blog-isnt-on-medium-3b280282fbae" target="__blank" rel="noreferrer">this article</OuterLink>, 
**it feels good to have my own little corner of internet for the first time**. (though in my case I did some blogging when I was 12 :p with webnode)

The topics you'll find in this blog will be varied, from general or common issues to more specific and complex ones. I'll be talking mainly about web development, though some random topics may appear on the way! 

Last but no least, I want to make clear that I'm not an expert on any of the topics I'll be talking about, so any constructive criticism is more than welcome! It will help to improve the quality of the content and hence the answer it can be given to anyone looking for that specific problem.

With that said, happy coding and enjoy the reading!


Salut! 

David
